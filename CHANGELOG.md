## Backend Updates

### Environment & Tooling

- Added `.env` for storing environment variables.
- Installed and configured **Prisma** ORM.
- Installed and configured **Mongoose** for MongoDB integration.

### Architecture

- Created a modular controller structure for:

  - `joinRoom`

  - `sendMessage`
  - `getMessages`
  - `createRoom`
  - `joinRoom`
  - `userJoined`
  - `ownerChanged`
  - `userLeft`
  - `getUserRooms`
  - `typing`
  - `stopTyping`
  - `newMessage`
  - `getRoomMessages`
  - `removeUserFromRoom`
  - `userRemoved`
  - `checkRooms`

- Updated `registerSocketHandlers` to delegate socket events to controller functions.

### Logic Improvements

- Added typing indicators: `typing`, `stopTyping`.
- Implemented real-time message creation and emission with Prisma persistence.
- Enabled room admin reassignment when the current owner leaves.

### üîê Security & Stability

- Configured **CORS** to allow frontend-origin requests.
